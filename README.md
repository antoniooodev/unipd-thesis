## Getting Started

### With a Local LaTeX Installation

*[See below](#with-a-remote-cloud-based-service) for alternatives to a local LaTeX installation*

*See ‚Äú[minimal installation](minimal_installation)‚Äù for instructions on how to build/use a minimal installation of LaTeX (<100 MB vs. 5GB for tex-live), which is just enough to compile the template successfully*

1. Download LaTeX:
   * **Windows:** install [TeX-Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) or [MikTeX](https://miktex.org).
   * **Linux:** install [TeX-Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) or [MikTeX](https://miktex.org).
   * **macOS:** install [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) (a macOS version of [TeX-Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)) or [MikTeX](https://miktex.org).
2. Download ‚Äúunipdthesis‚Äù by either:
   * Cloning the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BIRSAx2/unipdthesis) with <kbd>git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/BIRSAx2/unipdthesis.git</kbd>; or
   <!-- * Downloading the [latest version from the GitHub repository as a Zip file](https://github.com/BIRSAx2/unipdthesis/archive/main.zip) -->
3. Compile the document with you favorite LaTeX processor (pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX):
   * The main file is named ‚Äú*template.tex*‚Äù.
   * Either load it in your favorite [LaTeX text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors) or compile it in the terminal with
     <kbd>latexmk -shell-escape -file-line-error  -pdf template</kbd>.  If you use a LaTeX text editor, please notice that the NOVAthesis template uses `biber`and not `bibtex` to process the bibliography, which means that most probably you have to open the _Editor Preferences_ and somewhere (depends on the Editor) change `bibtex`to `biber`.
   * If Murphy is elsewhere, LaTeX will create the file ‚Äú`template.pdf`‚Äù, which you may open with your favorite PDF viewer.
4. Edit the files in the ‚Äú*Config*‚Äù folder:
