% WHICH LISTS/INDEXES TO PRINT?
%         syntax: \ntaddlistof{list-name}
%   You may add more lists if you want to, but please notice that the
%   initial "\" is always omitted in the “list-name”
%=============================================================================

\ntaddlistof{tableofcontents}    % The Table of Contents. Probably you want to leave this as is! ;)
\ntaddlistof{listoffigures}      % The List of Figures. Comment to omit.
\ntaddlistof{listoftables}       % The List of Tables. Comment to omit.
